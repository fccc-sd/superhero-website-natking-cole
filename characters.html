    <h2> Batman Villians</h2>
        <p>
            There are plenty enemies Batman faces in Gotham City on a nightly basis.  These enemies play
            a very important role when it comes to his character.  Some of these villians hate Batman, but many, you
            would be surprised to know, admire, and even love him. 
        </p>

    <h3 class = "names">Joker</h3>
        <p>
            Joker is Batman's mortal (and immorta) enemy. 
            The dynamic between the two is one of both love and hate.
            Joker openly states in many comics that he loves Batman, while
            Batman always responds with hate. Though, in some comics, such as Batman:
            Endgame, Batman considers Joker an old, close friend.  Joker's main motive
            in most of the comics is to simply "dance" with Batman. They are equals
            in his mind.
        </p>

    <h3 class = "names">Riddler</h3>
        <p>
            Riddler( Aka Edward Nigma) is in the same boat in Joker in the sense that he 
            doesn't hate Batman.  He resents him, while also seeking him out.
            A rivalry. Riddler grew up a genius, winning awards, building gadgets,
            and solving riddles, winning competitions for it.  He did all this obsessively
            because his father, a drunk, refused to acknowledge his intelligence.
            His father believed he was as dumb as a rock, he believed Edward Nigma
            lied about all his awards.  He never got the validation in his childhood,
            so his character obsessively tries to prove both to Batman and the rest of
            the world that he is as smart as it gets.
        </p>

    <h3 class = "names">Two Face</h3>
        <p>
            Two Face (Aka Harvey Dent) was a close friend of Bruce Wayne.  He was 
            the District Attorney of Gotham.  In most stories, while he was at a debate,
            Sal Maroni, a mob boss, threw acid at his face, melting half his face off
            and exposing bone and muscle.  The trauma of this incident caused him to 
            have 'A split personality' (While it may be called that in the comics, it 
            is nothing like the condition in real life) with a good and bad side in 
            reference to justice.  The normal part of Dent is morally right and often
            questions his other parts decisions.  His other side, the dark side, 
            often is almost abusive to the moral part of Harvey Dent and almost always
            wins over in arguments.  His reason for committing crime is revenge against
            Gotham for turning him into a monster even though he tried to help as a District
            Attorney.  It shattered his view on justice and now he feels the need to take 
            it out on everyone else.

        </p>

    <h3 class = "names">Clayface</h3>
        <p>
            Clayface (Aka Basil Karlo) has simple motive and an unclear 
            background.  Clayface has the ability to become anybody at all.
            At least physically.  In his backstory, Karlo was a world reknowned
            actor, however he was past his prime and he stopped getting roles. 
            Desperate to continue his passion, he experimented with a substance 
            that gave him the ability to turn into clay. He often is in the stories
            because he is looking for his "perfect role." A good example of this is Batman:
            Arkham City, where he follows Joker's plan without recieving anything
            in return simply because "It was the 
            role of a lifetime."
        </p>

    <h3 class = "names">Mr. Freeze</h3>
        <p>
            Mr Freeze (Aka Victor Friess) has a sad backstory.  His wife, Nora 
            became ill with a condition which has no cure.  He cryogenically froze
            Nora, hoping freezing her in time would keep her alive as he desperately 
            tried to find a cure for her.  During these experiments, he had an accident 
            with the cryo that turned him into an ice man.  Most of his stories revolve around
            elaborate, evil plans that he believes will help him find a cure for his wife.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are so many more, and I could go on and on, but I will move on to allies.
        </p>

    <h2> Allies </h2>
    <h3 class = "names">Catwoman</h3>
        <p>
            I debated putting Catwoman(Aka Selina Kyle) in the villian section,
            however she is more ally than enemy in most comics.  Seline Kyle is a 
            love interest, enemy, and ally of Batman all at once.  She is a burgular
            with a love for cats.  She usually knows Batman's identity. They often argue, 
            but rarely does Batman turn her in.  She is hardly a bad person, most of the time
            she is actually the voice of reason, even when if on her own she is selfish.
        </p>

    <h3 class = "names"> Robin </h3>
        <p>
            There are so many Robins that they cannot all be addressed.
            Robin is a title passed on generation to generation.  The main 
            Robins are:
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Dick Grayson - now Nightwing</li>
                <li>Jason Todd - now Redhood</li>
                <li>Tim Drake - now Red Robin</li>
                <li>Stephanie Brown - previously Spoiler, now Batgirl</li>
                <li>Damian Wayne - current Robin</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            Some of these names will be familiar to everyone, some not so much.
            Stephanie Brown was the character of a minor Batman villian, Cluemaster.
            Damian Wayne is the only biological kid belonging to Bruce Wayne.
        </p>

    <h3 class = "names"> Alfred </h3>
        <p>
            Alfred Pennyworth is Bruce's primary caretaker growing up as well as his Butler.
            He is sassy but elegant.  He is fiercly protective over Bruce and often
            can talk Bruce down from situations he knows are avoidable.
            He is an iconic character in DC and even has his own show.
        </p>

    <h3 class = "names"> Oracle </h3>
        <p>
            Oracle (Aka Barbara Gordon) is the daughter of commissioner James
            Gordon.  She used to be Batgirl, however during the comic 'The Killing Joke'
            Joker shot her in the spine, leaving her paralyzed and wheelchair bound.
            She still wanted to help Bruce, as her being kind is a big part of her 
            character. She became Oracle.  She often is the one researching and informing
            Batman mid mission.
