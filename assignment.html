                        The general storyline claims Bruce, after he became an adult, 
                        learned his techniques from Tibetan monks. They didn't directly teach 
                        him, but he learned through his time in a monastery. There is other variations
                        aswell, such as him fighting in gladiators, or a particular monk training him in everything.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That mentioned, the most substantial problem is his reliance on
                        his villains.  Joker, for example, is closer to Batman than his own 
                        allies.  It is a thin line between love and hate and Batman ignores the line.
                        He needs Joker to make himself feel sane.  There was even a comic (The Joker | Injustice:
                        Gods Among Us) where Superman killed Joker because Batman wouldnt. Later
                        in the Batcave, Superman gets into an argument with Batman, where he accuses Batman
                        of missing the Joker, of missing the fights. Batman stays silent.
                    </p>
