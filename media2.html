    <h2> Batman Video Games</h2>
        <p>
            There are plenty of amazing video games about Batman.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main series most people know is the 
            'Batman: Arkham' series.  It contains four games. 
            Arkham Asylum, Arkham Origins, Arkham City, And Arkham Knight.
            It creates its own world where you have a main goal of saving the 
            city from one of the many antagonists,
            but between missions you have the oppurtunity, and sometimes the obligation, to 
            participate in side missions.
        </p>

        <p> The Arkham series follows a chronological order. Arkham Origins is the first
            in order, and it is a game about the beginnings of the villains as well 
            as the beginnings of Batman himself.
            There is Riddler, Joker, Black Mask, and minor characters such as Copperhead, 
            the Electrocuitioner, Deadshot, Firefly, and many many others.
            The main goal of this game is to survive through the assassins sent to kill
            Batman and take down Joker. This is my favorite of the series.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next game, Arkham Asylum, follows the plot of Joker taking over
            An island dedicated to containing super villains and creating "Titans."
            This is using the drug Bane uses to beef himself up. Your goal is to yet again,
            take down Joker and destroy the drug.  This is my least favorite of the series.
        </p>

        <p> 
            The following game is Arkham Ciy. Joker poisons you with his own blood, which 
            was deadly due to the following game, and it is Batman's responsibilty to find a cure, not to save
            Joker and himself, but to save the City that was also poisoned. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The final game, Arkham Knight, I have yet to play.  
        </p>

        <p>
            There is also the telltale series. This is a choice based game and 
            completely changes the characters of Joker and Harley Quinn.  This was my first
            ever Batman game.
        </p>
    
    <h2> Batman Comics</h2>
        <p>
            Batman comics is by far the most entertaining media in my opinion.
