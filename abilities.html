    <h2> Batman's Strengths </h2>
        <p>
            For all the negative issues surrounding Batman, he has many 
            strengths.  For one, he is extremely strong.  Years of training has
            given him the ability to fall from towers, and survive. Comic logic.
            He is also highly intelligent.  This is plainly obvious just by reading 
            the comics, but it is only emphasized in comics where Riddler is involved.
            Riddler gives only the best of the best the time of day when talking to him.
            He actively seeks Batman out, he has never bested Batman. His endurance, both
            mentally and physically is also very important. He witnesses many
            of his allies die, as well as his villains. (He has cried plenty when Joker dies!) 
            One of the big ones talked about alot is how unstoppable
            he is whenever he is prepared. 
            Batman has fought against insane villains and survived solely
            because he was able to prepare himself for them. Undeniably, the only reason Batman succeeded how he did, was the cash in his pockets.
            It would be insane to imagine Bruce Wayne being the caliber of a hero he is 
            without the money he has.  His money allows him to buy state of the art equipment
            (have you seen the Batcave?!) as well as technology.  He also has the connections
            such as the Kane family and Lucius Fox, his main engineer.  
        </p>

        <p> In order of most important to least, this is the importance of each of these strengths:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Money</li>
                <li>Connections</li>
                <li>Preparation</li>
                <li>Intelligence</li>
                <li>Endurance</li>
                <li>Strength</li>
            </ol>
        <p> There are so many more strengths that could be mentioned, 
            but these are his main traits
        </p>

    <h2> Batman's Weaknesses </h2>
        <p>
            In my opinion, Batman has more weaknesses than he does strengths.
            One of the biggest ones is his twisted sense of Justice. Like I mentioned
            on the Home Page, Batman is rocky when it comes to his morals.  As much
            as he claims his work is centered around keeping streets safe, he is more focused on
            finding an outlet for the pent up anger in him.  This is evident in so many 
            comics where he either snaps at a villain and goes too far, (Such as in the White Knight series
            where he shoves multiple bottles of pills down Joker's throat, causing him to be arrested and
            sent to Arkham himself,) or even his own allies.  There are plenty of
            comics where he gets in physical altercations with Batgirl, Robin, Superman, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            That mentioned, the most substantial problem is his reliance on
            his villains.  Joker, for example, is closer to Batman than his own 
            allies.  It is a thin line between love and hate and Batman ignores the line.
            He needs Joker to make himself feel sane.  There was even a comic (The Joker | Injustice:
            Gods Among Us) where Superman killed Joker because Batman wouldnt. Later
            in the Batcave, Superman gets into an argument with Batman, where he accuses Batman
            of missing the Joker, of missing the fights. Batman stays silent.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the most famous issues, even joked about in Lego Batman, is Batman's 
            inability to let anyone get close to him. This leads to issues in comics such as
            Batman: Death of the Family, not to be confused with the iconic comic, Death <em>in</em> the Family, 
            (Death of the family also ties in to Batman's inability to let go of Joker.)
            Since Batman was unable to prioritize his family instead of his enemies, 
            the Bat-Family breaks up and they all avoid Bruce, feeling alientated after
            an extremely traumatizing experience.
