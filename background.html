    <h2> Why so many variations? </h2>
        <p>
            One of the best things about Batman is how many different
            storylines give different interpretations of him.  This means
            there is some variation between most stories when it comes to his 
            background.
        </p>
    
    <h2> His Backstory</h2>

            Although there is a lot of variation between each storyline, the 
            basis of his backstory remains the same.  A young Bruce Wayne went
            to go see "The Legend of Zorro" with his parents at a theater.  
            Instead of waiting for the car to come to the theater, Thomas Wayne 
            decided to cut through an alley way known as Crime Alley.  The Waynes
            then got held at gunpoint by Joe Chill. Bruce watched as Chill shot both 
            his mother and his father in cold blood, stealing his mothers pearl necklace.
            He was the only survivor. The police show up and we meet a young Commissioner James 
            Gordon. Alfred, Bruce's butler, comes to pick Bruce up.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is where the story starts to diverge.  Some stories say Alfred 
            pushed Bruce to learn the skills he needed to be Batman.  Some claim
            Alfred urged against it.  Some say Bruce did it all on his own and Alfred
            simply didn't stop him.
        </p>

    <h2> Where He Was Trained </h2>

        <p>
            <img src="./images/youngbruce.webp" class = "rightalign"  alt="Young Bruce in a cave" height="120" width="150" >
            The general storyline claims Bruce, after he became an adult, 
            learned his techniques from Tibetan monks. They didn't directly teach 
            him, but he learned through his time in a monastery. There is other variations
            aswell, such as him fighting in gladiators, or a particular monk training him in everything.
        </p>

    <h2> Why Bats? </h2>
        <p>
            The two main stories I have heard as to why Bruce chose a Bat to
            represent him both start at the same issue. Fear. In both the stories 
            i've come to hear, Bruce chose the image of a bat because he was afraid
            of them.  In one, a flock of bats fly over and scare him after his 
            parent's murder.  In another, he had wandered around his estate and fell into a cave
            filled with bats where he was stuck for hours.  He wanted to overcome his fear by embracing it.
        </p>

    <h2> His Justification </h2>
    <hr>
        <p>
            There are reasons Batman does what he does.  This is where
            the Batman community can become a bit divided.  Bruce's reasons for 
            his crime fighting sprees are vague, but guided.  My interpretation 
            paints Batman in a more negative light.  Batman is perpetually angry and
            needs something to take it out on.  He isn't about justice like he claims,
            that is simply a mask.  No, if Bruce cared about justice, he would lock his 
            criminals up.  He would be able to justify killing.  Instead, he lets 
            them escape, both from Arkham and from himself in multiple comics.
            His motive for his crime fighting is an outlet to let his anger out 
            on those who, in his and societies mind, deserve it. But his 
            justification is that these are criminals, but no one deserves to die.
            It is a dance.  In many many comics it is implied, and sometimes outright
            stated, that Batman values his villains more than his allies.  
        </p>

        <p>
            This is why Batman is such a fantastic character.  He has enough depth
            that my interpretation of his motives could start an insane argument.
