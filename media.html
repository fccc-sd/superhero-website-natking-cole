    <h2> TV versions </h2>
        <p>
            Although I think this is the least enjoyable category of media,
            one of the most common ones would be movies and tv shows.
        </p>
    <h3> Movies </h3>
        <p>
            Some of the most famous Batman movies would be 'The Dark Knight Trilogy.'
            This is actually one of my least favorite interpretations of the Joker.
            The acting was great, but I feel they didn't capture the essence of Comic
            joker in this version, however, I do agree it is an amazing movie and created it's own
            world.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is also 'The Joker' movies.  I haven't seen the second one yet,
            but I didnt particularly like this iconic movie either.  Again, the interpretation
            of Joker is not comic accurate, and by giving him a movie about his backstory,
            they take away one of the key aspects of Joker, the mystery surrounding him.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then there is the earlier movies 'Batman Forever' and 
            'Batman Returns.'  These are all classics, and most of the time hilarious. 
        </p>

        <p>
            There is also a 'Lego Batman' movie. This movie is hilarious and not a single
            person dislikes it. It simplifies the complex themes of Batman to classics
            tropes.
        </p>

        <p>
            How could I forget the brand new 'The Batman' movie? I did not enjoy 
            this one that much either in terms of Bruce Wayne's character.  The rest of the 
            movie was amazing.  However, they turned from a charismatic bachelor
            to an unsociable man who was obsessed with moping around.  Bruce Wayne 
            <em>MUST</em> be charismatic.  If not, Batman and Bruce Wayne leak together
            and they are so different, they are pratically separate characters.  This 
            is by far my favorite movie up to date, though.  The atmosphere is unbelivably
            amazing and the interpretation of Batman himself is decent enough.
        </p>

    <h3> TV shows</h3>
        <p> This is the most creative category in my opinion.
            Most TV shows surrounding Batman decide to take creative liberities
            in hopes of creating an iconic version of the characters.
        </p>

        <p>
            My favorite series, and the one that got me into Batman, was 'Gotham.'
            Gotham is a tv show about Bruce Wayne growing up and the origin stories of
            some of the villains. It is amazing, it reinvisions the characers
            in their own way.  They touch on so many characters such as Ra's Al Ghul,
            Silver St. Cloud, Solomon Grundy, Penguin, Riddler, Joker, Catowman, Poison Ivy,
            and so many others. It is unironically the best show I have ever seen. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Another extremely good series, though it isn't about Batman, is 'The Penguin.'
            It is absolutely amazing and captures the early stages of Penguins character and
            background beautifully.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most famous TV show, however, is the Batman Tv series that aired in 
            the 60s.  It is a relic, and the entertaining simplified version of Batman.
            There was great scenes, hilarious show over all.
