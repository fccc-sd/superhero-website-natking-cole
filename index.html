            Hello! My absolute favoite superhero is Batman!
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose to do Batman because i've enjoyed Batman since I was 
            little.  As I got older, I only became more interested.  I know
            more about Batman than any other character.  He is one of the 
            longest running, and simply one of the best written, superheros of 
            all time.

            and weaknesses, his allies, enemies, and some of the most famous media
            surrounded around him.
