            Hello! My absolute favoite superhero is Batman!
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose to do Batman because i've enjoyed Batman since I was 
            little.  As I got older, I only became more interested.  I know
            more about Batman than any other character.  He is one of the 
            longest running, and simply one of the best written, superheros of 
            all time.
        </p>

        <p>
            This website is dedicated to explaining Batman's backstory, his strengths 
            and weaknesses, his allies, enemies, and some of the most famous media
            surrounded around him.
